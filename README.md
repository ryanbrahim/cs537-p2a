# wish - Wisconsin Shell

This is a homemade command line shell for Unix-like systems.

To use wish, first compile the source by running the Makefile

```
make
```

Then, run the output

```
./wish
```

Finally, this should produce the wish prompt

```
wish>
```

Now you can begin executing commands.
